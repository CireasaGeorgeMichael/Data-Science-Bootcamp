Capstone project 2 : Data Visualisation.

Requirements :
  - Select a dataset from one of the online platforms.
  - Do EDA on the dataset.
  - Display insights from the data through markdown and graphs.
  - Create an EDA_doc.docx to present the EDA of the data.

For this project I selected the Employee Attrition dataset from www.kaggle.com
and explored it.
 - The full report is in the EDA_doc.docx file.
