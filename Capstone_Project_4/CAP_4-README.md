Capstone project 4 : Bookstore management using a SQL database.

For this project, you are required to create a program for a bookstore. The program
should allow the clerk to enter data about new books into the database, update
book information, delete books from the database and search to find the
availability of books in the database.
    
Requirements :
 - The program should allow the clerk to:
   - add new books to the database
   - update book information
   - delete books from the database
   - search the database to find a specific book 

Optional I added a menu option to display all books in the database.

For this project split the code into two modules, allowing me to  keep
the structure and purpose of each module much cleaner.
 - bookstore_manager.py 
   - is the main program with the functionality of the menu.
 - bookstore_functions.py
   - contains all the custom functions that are used in the main script
    for manipulating the data of the database.
